# JSGame
Let's build up that fitness website!

## Front-End
- We will need the **CONTENT** for this website. For now I filled it up with lorem-ipsum text.
- What information will we display for the Users? Not just for the index page but any other pages related on the site.
- How many pages will we create for this website?
    - Will one of those pages be the survey or is the suvey through JavaScript?
    - Maybe there can be a contact page so Users can get in touch with the personal trainer that fits their fitness survey answers.
- Gather images to display onto our webpage. The larger the image, the higher quality it needs to have. Since this is more of a test run, stock photos will suffice.
- Is there a form submission? Helpful for the back-end portion to know this. Also taken into account if we follow through with creating the contact page.

## Back-End
- What will be the logic behind the creation of this fitness survey?
    - This may contain lots of if else statments and functions. Up for the challenge.
    - Will it be like a Buzzfeed quiz/survey or be more analytical? This will be important when modeling the functionality of this fitness survey.
- Do we want the survey displayed as an alert box or have its own separate page?
- What other JavaScript tools can we incorporate in this project? 
    - Perhaps a game where the User can choose the workout regimine or diet that best fits them.
    - If we want to go the extra mile, perhaps include an API on fitness or nutrition that the User can log information about
- Lasty, it would be nice if we can store the User information on the website. That way once they close the tab and reopen it, or visit the website later, all of their survey fitness info is there and it caters to the Users needs.
